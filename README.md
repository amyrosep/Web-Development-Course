This is a collection of web pages and apps from a [web development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) I took on Udemy in 2021. As always in these exercises, I try to write ahead on the projects and factor them in my own way. 

I learned a lot of web development fundamentals I was missing from years focused only on Android development. Learning HTML/CSS/Javascript with Bootstrap was an effective foundation in web basics. The course then venture toward Node.Js, MongoDB, and React.

I really had a great time going through the material and brushing up on some skills. The course is well paced for a beginner, but it's also structured so that it is easy enough to skip things I was already familiar with.
